# CSCI-C200 Final Project

_School Registrar System_

## Welcome

This was my first large project created using Python. There are three main modules: Admin, Student, and Instructor. Each has their own executable file.

To start the program, you must sign in as a valid Admin user. Valid usernames and passwords are provided in the admin.csv file.

The program will generate csv files, based on the data entered.

Initial CSV:
admin.csv

Executable Files:
adminExecutable.py
instructorExecutable.py
studentExecutable.py

Class Files:
adminClass.py
courseClass.py
instructorsClass.py
studentsClass.py
userClass.py

Utility File:
utility.py

CSV Generated by Program:
courses.csv
enrollments.csv
instructors.csv
students.csv

Thanks for checking out my project! I received a 100% :)
